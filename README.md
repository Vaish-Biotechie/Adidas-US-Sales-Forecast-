The Adidas US sales dataset contains daily sales of different products across various retailers in different regions, states and cities for a two year period (i.e. 2020 and 2021). 

2. Project objective
To forecast sales of different products for next 12 months (i.e. 2022)

3. Major Steps involved
   a. Import Libraries and Dataset
   b. Data Analysis using graphs, descriptive statistics etc to understand the data
   c. Creation of Analytical Dataset
   d. Built Holtwinters Model to forecast the sales for next 12 months and improvised model accuracy by tuning the hyperparameters.

Result:

The HoltWinter's Model built for six different products shows an average accuracy of 87%
